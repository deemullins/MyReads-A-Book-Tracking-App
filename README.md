# MyReads Project

In the MyReads project, we created a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application, an API server, and client library that will be used as you interact with the application.

## Directions

To install the application:

* clone or download the zip file [here](https://github.com/deemullins/MyReads-A-Book-Tracking-App).
* run:
```
npm install
``` 
* run: 
```
npm start
```
